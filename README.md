# Object_Detection_And_Annotation


Executive Summary

This capstone project focuses on video object detection and annotation using OpenCV and the BDD100K dataset. The primary objectives include converting video types, exploring video frames, and adding annotations to identify and highlight objects within the video. The project aims to provide insights into the practical application of computer vision techniques in real-world scenarios, such as surveillance or autonomous vehicles.


Introduction

Problem Statement

The project addresses the need for efficient video object detection and annotation techniques. The capability to recognize and annotate objects in a video stream is essential for various applications, including traffic monitoring, security surveillance, and autonomous vehicle navigation.


Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:
1.	Convert video types using FFmpeg to facilitate processing.
2.	Explore and visualize frames from the video using OpenCV.
3.	Implement object detection and annotation on video frames.
4.	Generate a labeled video output highlighting detected objects.



Implementation

Video Conversion

The project begins by converting the input video file to a more suitable format using FFmpeg. This step ensures compatibility with OpenCV for subsequent processing.
Frame Exploration
Explore and analyze individual frames from the video to gain insights into the data. This includes retrieving information such as the number of frames, frame dimensions, and frame rate.
Object Detection and Annotation
Implement object detection by adding annotations to identify and highlight specific objects in the video frames. The color-coded rectangles and text labels facilitate the identification of different object categories.



Video Compilation

Compile the annotated frames into a video to visualize the results. The video is saved in a compressed format for practical use and sharing.



Results

The project successfully converts the video, explores individual frames, detects objects, and adds annotations. The labeled video output provides a clear representation of the identified objects, contributing to the overall understanding of the video content.



Challenges and Limitations

1.	Frame Rate Mismatch: The labeling information may have a different frame rate than the video frames, requiring adjustments for accurate annotations.
2.	Processing Time: Processing large video files may be computationally intensive, impacting the overall runtime of the annotation process.



Future Enhancements

1.	Real-Time Object Detection: Explore real-time object detection for applications requiring immediate processing of video streams.
2.	Improved Annotation Accuracy: Investigate advanced object detection models and fine-tuning techniques to enhance annotation accuracy.



Conclusion

This capstone project demonstrates the application of OpenCV for video object detection and annotation. By converting video types, exploring frames, and adding annotations, the project provides a foundational understanding of computer vision techniques applicable to diverse domains.
